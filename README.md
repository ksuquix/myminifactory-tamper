# myminifactory-tamper

I made this script to aid in downloading collections and objects from myminifactory.

* Download all files instead of clicking download on every single one
* Download all renders

* <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksuquix/myminifactory-tamper/main/myminifactory.user.js">Click to Install</a>
